# Plaid CTF 2014: rendezvous

**Category:** Misc
**Points:** 250
**Description:**

> The Plague has a friend called Alice who has some secrets on [a Tor service](http://6c4dm56aer6xn2h2.onion/). We think if we can talk to her, we can learn some useful things about The Plague. Unfortunately she will only rendezvous with "chandler" when he brings a cookie with "beef" baked into it. Can you help us find her secret?
